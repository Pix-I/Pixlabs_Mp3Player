# Pixlabs_Mp3Player
A simple server based Mp3Player that'll play a Mp3File located on the host computer.

The server side uses the Spring-Boot framework to serve/link pages and send information to the host computer about what
song has to be played.

The files are stored as object to make them easier to find, they're stored asobjects extending the Mp3agicFile type.

The files are played thanks to the Javazoom.jl.decoder. 

If you have any questions, feel free to message me, either on github or via mail at: Pix-I@pix-labs.com
I hope you'll find something usefull in here.
